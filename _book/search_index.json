["linear-regression.html", "Chapter 2 Linear Regression 2.1 Data 2.2 Simple linear regression, Residuals &amp; Least squares 2.3 Multiple regression 2.4 Predictors with two categories", " Chapter 2 Linear Regression You probably learned something about linear regression in a previous course. Here, we briefly review the main concepts of simple linear regression and quickly expand our tool box to multiple regression (with both quantitative and categorical predictors). 2.1 Data We will consider a small dataset from an article by J.S. Martin and colleagues, titled Facial width-to-height ratio is associated with agonistic and affiliative dominance in bonobos (Pan paniscus) Notes: variable fWHR is the facial width-height ratio and AssR is the Assertiveness score of affiliative dominance. normDS is another dominance score. A few figures of the data are below - we will do some more exploration together. ## Observations: 117 ## Variables: 8 ## $ Name &lt;fct&gt; Zuani, Zuani, Zorba, Zorba, Zorba, Zomi, Zomi, Zamba, Z... ## $ Group &lt;fct&gt; Apenheul, Apenheul, Wilhelma, Wilhelma, Wilhelma, Frank... ## $ Sex &lt;fct&gt; Female, Female, Male, Male, Male, Female, Female, Male,... ## $ Age &lt;int&gt; 22, 22, 34, 34, 34, 15, 15, 14, 14, 14, 18, 18, 18, 18,... ## $ fWHR &lt;dbl&gt; 1.475052, 1.321814, 1.581446, 1.479237, 1.390086, 1.340... ## $ AssR &lt;dbl&gt; 5.36, 5.36, 2.36, 2.36, 2.36, 3.92, 3.92, 4.74, 4.74, 4... ## $ normDS &lt;dbl&gt; 1.430, 1.430, 2.341, 2.341, 2.341, 3.087, 3.087, 3.035,... ## $ weight &lt;dbl&gt; 24.0, 24.0, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 41.6, 41.6, 41.6, 38.0,... 2.2 Simple linear regression, Residuals &amp; Least squares First, let’s review and consider a simple (one-predictor) linear regression model.

Can we improve the model by adding more predictors? mlr &lt;- lm(fWHR ~ AssR + weight, data=bonobos) coef(mlr) ## (Intercept) AssR weight ## 0.944790930 0.039888045 0.008644299 2.3.1 Is it really better? How do we know if the model with more predictors is “better”? (For a more detailed answer, wait about a week…) But before we can define a “beter” model: how did R find the “best” intercept and slopes? 2.3.2 Regression residuals = “errors” 2.3.3 Computing Predictions Use the regression equation to compute predicted values for the three data points below: ## fWHR AssR weight ## 8 1.880866 4.74 41.6 ## 25 1.798387 5.38 50.6 ## 41 1.591440 3.97 NA ## 65 1.545019 4.87 38.5 2.4 Predictors with two categories mlr2 &lt;- lm(fWHR ~ AssR + weight + Sex, data = bonobos) coef(mlr2) ## (Intercept) AssR weight SexMale ## 1.065420976 0.058435841 0.002257142 0.128484275 How does the model incorporate this covariate mathematically? 2.4.1 Predictors with more categories gf_boxplot(fWHR ~ Group, data = bonobos) mlr3 &lt;- lm(fWHR ~ AssR + weight + Sex + Group, data = bonobos) coef(mlr3) ## (Intercept) AssR weight SexMale ## 1.007734691 0.064361973 0.003458979 0.124854271 ## GroupFrankfurt GroupPlanckendael GroupTwycross GroupWilhelma ## 0.037426358 -0.008464572 -0.112907589 0.011186724 ## GroupWuppertal ## -0.004364826 How does the model incorporate this covariate mathematically?

If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 7.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 7.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 7.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 7.1: Here is a nice table!
