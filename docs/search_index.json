Here, we briefly review the main concepts of simple linear regression and quickly expand our tool box to multiple regression (with both quantitative and categorical predictors). 2.1 Data We will consider a small dataset from an article by J.S. Martin and colleagues, titled Facial width-to-height ratio is associated with agonistic and affiliative dominance in bonobos (Pan paniscus) Notes: variable fWHR is the facial width-height ratio and AssR is the Assertiveness score of affiliative dominance. normDS is another dominance score. A few figures of the data are below - we will do some more exploration together. ## Observations: 117 ## Variables: 8 ## $ Name &lt;fct&gt; Zuani, Zuani, Zorba, Zorba, Zorba, Zomi, Zomi, Zamba, Z... ## $ Group &lt;fct&gt; Apenheul, Apenheul, Wilhelma, Wilhelma, Wilhelma, Frank... ## $ Sex &lt;fct&gt; Female, Female, Male, Male, Male, Female, Female, Male,... ## $ Age &lt;int&gt; 22, 22, 34, 34, 34, 15, 15, 14, 14, 14, 18, 18, 18, 18,... ## $ fWHR &lt;dbl&gt; 1.475052, 1.321814, 1.581446, 1.479237, 1.390086, 1.340... ## $ AssR &lt;dbl&gt; 5.36, 5.36, 2.36, 2.36, 2.36, 3.92, 3.92, 4.74, 4.74, 4... ## $ normDS &lt;dbl&gt; 1.430, 1.430, 2.341, 2.341, 2.341, 3.087, 3.087, 3.035,... ## $ weight &lt;dbl&gt; 24.0, 24.0, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 41.6, 41.6, 41.6, 38.0,... 2.2 Simple linear regression, Residuals &amp; Least squares First, let’s review and consider a simple (one-predictor) linear regression model.

How do we know if the model with more predictors is “better”? (For a more detailed answer, wait about a week…) But before we can define a “beter” model: how did R find the “best” intercept and slopes? 2.3.2 Regression residuals = “errors” 2.3.3 Computing Predictions Use the regression equation to compute predicted values for the three data points below: ## fWHR AssR weight ## 8 1.880866 4.74 41.6 ## 25 1.798387 5.38 50.6 ## 41 1.591440 3.97 NA ## 65 1.545019 4.87 38.5 2.4 Predictors with two categories mlr2 &lt;- lm(fWHR ~ AssR + weight + Sex, data = bonobos) coef(mlr2) ## (Intercept) AssR weight SexMale ## 1.065420976 0.058435841 0.002257142 0.128484275 How does the model incorporate this covariate mathematically? 2.4.1 Predictors with more categories gf_boxplot(fWHR ~ Group, data = bonobos) mlr3 &lt;- lm(fWHR ~ AssR + weight + Sex + Group, data = bonobos) coef(mlr3) ## (Intercept) AssR weight SexMale ## 1.007734691 0.064361973 0.003458979 0.124854271 ## GroupFrankfurt GroupPlanckendael GroupTwycross GroupWilhelma ## 0.037426358 -0.008464572 -0.112907589 0.011186724 ## GroupWuppertal ## -0.004364826 How does the model incorporate this covariate mathematically? 2.5 Returning to the R Model Summary There are several bits of information you should be able to extract from the summary() output R produces on a fitted linear regression model: \\(\\beta\\)s, Coefficient Estimates \\(\\sigma\\), labeled “residual standard error” \\(R^2\\) (adjusted) mlr3 &lt;- lm(fWHR ~ AssR + weight + Sex + Group, data = bonobos) summary(mlr3) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = fWHR ~ AssR + weight + Sex + Group, data = bonobos) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -0.38288 -0.09488 -0.02642 0.07196 0.48464 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

This error is because the lm() function removes rows containing missing values from the dataset, so it computes only 68 residuals (for the complete cases in the data). This doesn’t match the 117 rows in the original data. We can solve the problem by omitting rows with missing values first. To be safe, we first select only the variables we need, so we don’t omit rows based on missing values in unused variables. b2 &lt;- bonobos %&gt;% select(fWHR, weight, AssR, Sex, Group) %&gt;% na.omit() %&gt;% mutate(preds = predict(mlr3)) We have a full set of predictions! But if we plot these predictions on a scatter plot of fWHR as a function of AssR, we do not get a straight line, because the predictions are also impacted by varying values of weight, Sex, and Group: gf_point(fWHR ~ AssR, data = b2) %&gt;% gf_line(preds ~ AssR, data=b2) But…we would really like a straight line that helps us visualize the meaning of the \\(\\beta\\) (slope coefficient) for AssR. We can make predictions for a hypothetical dataset, in which AssR varies over a reasonable range, but the other predictors stay constant. This lets us see how AssR (and only AssR) affects the response, without contributions from other predictors. In choosing the values to include in hypothetical dataset, we often choose to hold variables constant at their most common or median values, but not blindly: also, avoid impossible or implausible variable combinations (for example, specifying that a person lives in the state of Michigan but the city of Chicago, or that they are a 5-year-old person with 4 children). In this case, to match the figures in the published paper, we are also going to vary the Sex - but generally you’d only allow one predictor to vary. fake_data &lt;- expand.grid(AssR = seq(from=1.8, to=5.7, by=0.05), weight = 38.5, Sex = c(&#39;Female&#39;, &#39;Male&#39;), Group = &#39;Wuppertal&#39;) fake_data &lt;- fake_data %&gt;% mutate(preds = predict(mlr3, newdata = fake_data)) gf_line(preds ~ AssR, color = ~Sex, data=fake_data) %&gt;% gf_labs(y=&#39;Predicted\\nfWHR&#39;) 2.6.2.1 Comprehension checks: Should we overlay prediction-plot line(s) on the data scatter plot? How do you think the plot would look if we changed the constant predictor values? What is missing from this picture? 2.6.2.2 Shortcut require(s245) pred_plot(mlr3, &#39;AssR&#39;) "],
