Here, we briefly review the main concepts of simple linear regression and quickly expand our tool box to multiple regression (with both quantitative and categorical predictors). 2.1 Data We will consider a small dataset from an article by J.S. Martin and colleagues, titled Facial width-to-height ratio is associated with agonistic and affiliative dominance in bonobos (Pan paniscus) Notes: variable fWHR is the facial width-height ratio and AssR is the Assertiveness score of affiliative dominance. normDS is another dominance score. A few figures of the data are below - we will do some more exploration together. ## Observations: 117 ## Variables: 8 ## $ Name [3m[38;5;246m&lt;fct&gt;[39m[23m Zuani, Zuani, Zorba, Zorba, Zorba, Zomi, Zomi, Zamba, Z... ## $ Group [3m[38;5;246m&lt;fct&gt;[39m[23m Apenheul, Apenheul, Wilhelma, Wilhelma, Wilhelma, Frank... ## $ Sex [3m[38;5;246m&lt;fct&gt;[39m[23m Female, Female, Male, Male, Male, Female, Female, Male,... ## $ Age [3m[38;5;246m&lt;int&gt;[39m[23m 22, 22, 34, 34, 34, 15, 15, 14, 14, 14, 18, 18, 18, 18,... ## $ fWHR [3m[38;5;246m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m 1.475052, 1.321814, 1.581446, 1.479237, 1.390086, 1.340... ## $ AssR [3m[38;5;246m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m 5.36, 5.36, 2.36, 2.36, 2.36, 3.92, 3.92, 4.74, 4.74, 4... ## $ normDS [3m[38;5;246m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m 1.430, 1.430, 2.341, 2.341, 2.341, 3.087, 3.087, 3.035,... ## $ weight [3m[38;5;246m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m 24.0, 24.0, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 41.6, 41.6, 41.6, 38.0,... 2.2 Simple linear regression, Residuals &amp; Least squares First, let‚Äôs review and consider a simple (one-predictor) linear regression model.

This error is because the lm() function removes rows containing missing values from the dataset, so it computes only 68 residuals (for the complete cases in the data). This doesn‚Äôt match the 117 rows in the original data. We can solve the problem by omitting rows with missing values first. To be safe, we first select only the variables we need, so we don‚Äôt omit rows based on missing values in unused variables. We have a full set of predictions! But if we plot these predictions on a scatter plot of fWHR as a function of AssR, we do not get a straight line, because the predictions are also impacted by varying values of weight, Sex, and Group: But‚Ä¶we would really like a straight line that helps us visualize the meaning of the \\(\\beta\\) (slope coefficient) for AssR. We can make predictions for a hypothetical dataset, in which AssR varies over a reasonable range, but the other predictors stay constant. This lets us see how AssR (and only AssR) affects the response, without contributions from other predictors. In choosing the values to include in hypothetical dataset, we often choose to hold variables constant at their most common or median values, but not blindly: also, avoid impossible or implausible variable combinations (for example, specifying that a person lives in the state of Michigan but the city of Chicago, or that they are a 5-year-old person with 4 children). In this case, to match the figures in the published paper, we are also going to vary the Sex - but generally you‚Äôd only allow one predictor to vary. fake_data &lt;- expand.grid(AssR = seq(from=1.8, to=5.7, by=0.05), weight = 38.5, Sex = c(&#39;Female&#39;, &#39;Male&#39;), Group = &#39;Wuppertal&#39;) fake_data &lt;- fake_data %&gt;% mutate(preds = predict(mlr3, newdata = fake_data)) gf_line(preds ~ AssR, color = ~Sex, data=fake_data) %&gt;% gf_labs(y=&#39;Predicted\\nfWHR&#39;) 2.6.2.1 Comprehension checks: Should we overlay prediction-plot line(s) on the data scatter plot? How do you think the plot would look if we changed the constant predictor values? What is missing from this picture? 2.6.2.2 Shortcut 2.7 Why are we doing this again? Why make prediction plots? 2.8 Shortcut Method - With Uncertainty We saw before that pred_plot() makes it very easy for us to generate prediction plots showing what a (multiple regression) model says about the relationship between the response and one of the predictors: Note the custom axis label - otherwise you get a long, unwieldy default ‚ÄúPredictions from fitted model‚Äù They look nice!

One missing piece is: If I have an appropriate model with a set of multiple predictors, how can I choose which predictors are worth retaining in a ‚Äúbest‚Äù model for the data (and which ones have no relationship, or a weak relationship, with the response, so should be discarded)? 3.1 Data and Model Today we will recreate part of the analysis from Vertebrate community composition and diversity declines along a defaunation gradient radiating from rural villages in Gabon, by Sally Koerner and colleagues. They investigated the relationship between rural villages, hunting, and wildlife in Gabon. They asked how monkey abundance depends on distance from villages, village size, and vegetation characteristics. They shared their data at Dryad.org and we can read it in and fit a regression model like this: ape_mod &lt;- lm(RA_Apes ~ Veg_DBH + Veg_Canopy + Veg_Understory + Veg_Rich + Veg_Stems + Veg_liana + LandUse + Distance + NumHouseholds, data = defaun) summary(ape_mod) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = RA_Apes ~ Veg_DBH + Veg_Canopy + Veg_Understory + ## Veg_Rich + Veg_Stems + Veg_liana + LandUse + Distance + NumHouseholds, ## data = defaun) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -3.9857 -0.9419 -0.0360 0.8239 6.3832 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

The basic idea is that we minimize the quantity \\(-(2LogLikelihood - penalty) = -2LogLikelihood + penalty\\) AIC is computed according to \\(-2LogLikelihood +2k\\), where \\(k\\) is the number of coefficients being estimated (don‚Äôt forget \\(\\sigma\\)!) Smaller AIC is better. BIC is computed according to \\(-2LogLikelihood + ln(n)k\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of observations (rows) in the dataset and \\(k\\) is the number of coefficients being estimated. Smaller BIC is better. Verify that the BIC for this model is 139.65. 3.3 Decisions with ICs The following rules of thumb (not laws, just common rules of thumb) may help you make decisions with ICs: A model with lower IC by at least 3 units is notably better. If two or more models have ICs within 3 IC units of each other, there is not a lot of difference between them. Here, we usually choose the model with fewest predictors. In some cases, if the research question is to measure the influence of some particular predictor on the response, but the IC does not strongly support including that predictor in the best model (IC difference less than 3), you might want to keep it in anyway and then discuss the situation honestly, for example, ‚ÄúAIC does not provide strong support for including predictor x in the best model, but the model including predictor x indicates that as x increases the response decreases slightly. More research would be needed‚Ä¶‚Äù 3.4 All-possible-subsets Selection The model we just fitted is our full model, with all predictors of potential interest included. How can we use information criteria to choose the best model from possible models with subsets of the predictors? We can use the dredge() function from the MuMIn package to get and display ICs for all these models. Before using dredge, we need to make sure our dataset has no missing values, and also set the ‚Äúna.action‚Äù input for our model (can be done in call to lm(..., na.action = 'na.fail') also).

AIC and BIC may give different best models, especially if the dataset is large. You may want to just choose one to use a priori (before making calculations). You might prefer BIC if you want to err on the ‚Äúconservative‚Äù side, as it is more likely to select a ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù model with fewer predictors. This is because of its larger penalty. 3.6 Quantities derived from AIC \\(\\Delta AIC\\) is the AIC for a given model, minus the AIC of the best one in the dataset. (Same for \\(\\Delta BIC\\)) Akaike weights are values (ranging from 0-1) that measure the weight of evidence suggesting that a model is the best one (given that there is one best one in the set) 3.7 Important Caution Very important: IC can ONLY be compared for models with the same response variable, and the exact same rows of data.

Among these households, information was collected about 4453 children under 5 years old, including their gf_dhistogram(~AN3, data=wt, binwidth=1) %&gt;% gf_labs(x=&#39;Weight (kg)&#39;, y=&#39;Probability\\nDensity&#39;) %&gt;% gf_fitdistr(dist=&#39;dnorm&#39;, size=1.3) %&gt;% gf_refine(scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(from=0, to=30, by=2))) 4.2 Review - the Normal probability density function (PDF) \\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}} \\] 4.3 A simple model The distribution of weights looks quite unimodal and symmetric, so we will model it with a normal distribution with mean 11.8 and standard deviation 3.53 (N( \\(\\mu=\\) 11.8, \\(\\sigma=\\) 3.53), black line). 4.4 Using the Model to Make Predictions If you had to predict the weight of one child from this population, what weight would you guess?

Which is more likely: three children who weigh 11, 8.2, and 13kg, or three who weigh 10, 12.5 and 15 kg? How did you: Find the likelihood of each observation? Combine the likelihoods of a set of three observations? What did you have to assume about the set of observations? 4.6 How does this relate to linear regression?

For each data point in the dataset, for a given regression model, we can compute a model prediction. We can subtract the prediction from the observed response-variable values to get the residuals. We can compute the likelihood (\\(L\\)) of this set of residuals by finding the likelihood of each individual residual \\(e_i\\) in a \\(N(0, \\sigma)\\) distribution. To get the likelihood of the full dataset given the model, we use the fact that the residuals are independent (they better be, because that was one of the conditions of of linear regression model) ‚Äì we can multiply the likelihoods of all the individual residuals together to get the joint likelihood of the full set. That is the ‚Äúlikelihood‚Äù that is used in the AIC and BIC calculations we considered earlier. "],
["pdfs-and-pmfs.html", "Chapter 5 PDFs and PMFs 5.1 Beyond Normal 5.2 Types of probability distributions 5.3 Relevant Features of Distributions 5.4 Examples of Continuous Distributions 5.5 Examples of Discrete Distributions", " Chapter 5 PDFs and PMFs 5.1 Beyond Normal In our exploration of likelihoods, we did a little bit of work with the Normal probability density function. Here, we will state some characteristics of the normal distribution slightly more formally, and then we will get familiar with some other probability distributions (a.k.a. ‚Äúthe normal distribution‚Äôs wierd friends‚Äù). 5.2 Types of probability distributions 5.2.1 Continuous distributions The probability distribution of a continuous variable (one that can take on continuous real values, at least within a certain range) is called a probability density function or PDF for short. PDFs are functions of one continuous variable (we‚Äôll call it \\(x\\)) that have two properties in common: The total area under the curve is 1 (\\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x)dx = 1\\)) The values of the function are non-negative (0, or a positive real number) for all real \\(x\\) (\\(f(x) \\geq 0 \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\)) For PDFs, the function values (\\(y\\)-axis values) are probability densities, useful for computing likelihoods; probabilities are given by finding areas under the curve. 5.2.2 Discrete Distributions We use categorical as well as quantitative variables in our regression models, so it will prove useful to have some discrete probability distributions as well as continuous ones. Discrete distributions associate each possible value of a discrete variable with its probability of occurence. A discrete probability distribution is characterized by a probability mass function or PMF for short (this is the discrete equivalent of a PDF). A PMF is a function of one discrete variable (we‚Äôll call it \\(x\\)) that have two properties in common: The sum of all the function‚Äôs values is 1 (\\(\\sum_{x \\in S} f(x) =1\\), where \\(S\\) is the set of all possible values \\(x\\) can have) All values of the function are between 0 and 1 inclusive (they are probabilities) (\\(f(x) \\in [0,1] \\forall x \\in S\\)) 5.3 Relevant Features of Distributions For this course, the most important features to note about each probability distribuiton will be: The type of distribution: discrete or continuous? The support of the distribution: what range of possible values can the random variable \\(X\\) take on? The parameters of the distribution. Changing the parameters tunes the center and shape of the distribution, so these are what we need to estimate to fit a particular kind of distribution to a specific dataset. (For example, the parameters of the normal distribution are the mean \\(\\mu\\) and the standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\).) The shape of the distribution: what shapes can the function take one? (For example, the normal distribution is always unimodal and symmetric.) The PDF or PMF of the distribution. What mathematical expression controls the shape of the distribution? We will also note a few examples of variables that might be well modelled by each distribution. 5.4 Examples of Continuous Distributions 5.4.1 Normal 5.4.1.0.1 Type Continuous 5.4.1.0.2 Support All real numbers 5.4.1.0.3 Parameters \\(\\mu\\), the mean, which can take on any real value \\(\\sigma\\), the standard deviation, which can take on any positive real value 5.4.1.0.4 Shapes The shape is always unimodal and symmetric. 5.4.1.0.5 PDF or PMF The normal distribution has PDF: \\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}e^{\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\\] 5.4.1.0.6 Examples A normal distribution might be a good fit for data on childrens‚Äô weights in kg, or for the duration of visits at a zoo, or‚Ä¶ 5.4.2 Gamma 5.4.2.0.1 Type Continuous 5.4.2.0.2 Support positive real numbers 5.4.2.0.3 Parameters There are two alternate but equivalent parameterizations for the gamma distribution. The first option: \\(\\alpha\\) (shape) and \\(\\beta\\) (rate), where \\(\\alpha&gt;0\\) and \\(\\beta&gt;0\\) The second option: \\(k\\) (shape) and \\(\\theta\\) (scale), where \\(k &gt;0\\) and \\(\\theta&gt;0\\). Converting between the two parameterizations: \\(\\alpha = k\\) and \\(\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\theta}\\). 5.4.2.0.4 Shapes The gamma distribution can take on a unimodal, symmetric shape or a unimodal shape with any amount of right skew (up to an exponential distribution shape). Note: you don‚Äôt need to be familiar with exactly how the different values of parameters influence the shape of the gamma distribution PDF, so the curves here are not labelled with parameter values. 5.4.2.0.5 PDF or PMF The gamma distribution has PDF: \\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(k) \\theta^k}x^{(k-1)}e^{\\frac{-x}{\\theta}}\\] Where \\(\\Gamma\\) is the Gamma function (look up the definition if you choose), or equivalently, \\[ f(x) = \\frac{\\beta^{\\alpha}}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)}x^{(\\alpha-1)}e^{-\\beta x}\\] 5.4.2.0.6 Examples Gamma distributions are often used to model things like wind speed or duration of an event (any quantity that might have right skew and is never negative). 5.4.3 Beta 5.4.3.0.1 Type Continuous 5.4.3.0.2 Support Real numbers between 0 and 1 ([0,1]) 5.4.3.0.3 Parameters \\(\\alpha\\) (shape 1) and \\(\\beta\\) (shape 2), both of which must be \\(&gt;1\\). 5.4.3.0.4 Shapes This distribution can take on almost any shape, for example: 5.4.3.0.5 PDF or PMF The PDF is: \\[ f(x) = \\frac{x^{(\\alpha -1)}(1-x)^{(\\beta-1)}}{ B(\\alpha, \\beta)}\\] Where \\(B\\) is the Beta function (again, feel free to look up the definition if you are interested). 5.4.3.0.6 Examples Beta distributions could be used for any variable that takes on values between 0-1, for example, baseball players‚Äô batting averages, or test scores (as proportions). 5.5 Examples of Discrete Distributions 5.5.1 Binomial 5.5.1.0.1 Type Discrete 5.5.1.0.2 Support You can think about the support of this distribution two ways. Technically, the support is \\(k= 0, 1,2,3,\\dots\\): 0 and positive integers, interpreted as the number of ‚Äúsuccesses‚Äù in \\(n\\) binomial trials. Binomial trials are independent observations of a process that has two possible outcomes, ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù or ‚Äúfailure‚Äù, with set probabilities of each occurring. (And probabilities of success and failure must sum to 1.) So, for each individual binomial trial, the possible outcomes are 0 and 1, often interpreted as TRUE and FALSE or ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù and ‚Äúfailure‚Äù. For our purposes, this distribution will be useful for modelling response variables that are categorical with two possible values (and the \\(n\\) trials will be the \\(n\\) rows in our dataset). 5.5.1.0.3 Parameters Parameters are \\(n\\), the number of independent trials, and \\(p\\), the probability of success in each trial. 5.5.1.0.4 Shapes The figure below shows the shape of binomial distributions with fixed \\(n=100\\) and varying \\(p\\): The \\(p\\) used were 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 0.99. Can you tell which is which? 5.5.1.0.5 PDF or PMF The PMF for the binomial distribution is: \\[ P(X=k \\vert n,p) = {n \\choose k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\\] Where \\(k\\) is the number of successes observed in \\(n\\) trials (you can think of \\(k\\) as our ‚Äúx-axis variable‚Äù for this PMF). 5.5.1.0.6 Examples We might use this distribution to model any categorical variable with two possible values, like Age (if possible values are ‚Äúadult‚Äù and ‚Äúchild‚Äù) or health status (‚Äúhas disease‚Äù or ‚Äúdoes not have disease‚Äù). We‚Äôll think of each observation in the dataset as one of the \\(n\\) indpendent trials, with one of two possible outcomes for each trial. 5.5.2 Poisson 5.5.2.0.1 Type Discrete 5.5.2.0.2 Support The support is 0 and positive integers (i.e., this distribution works well for count data). 5.5.2.0.3 Parameters The Poisson distribution has one parameter, \\(\\lambda\\) (the event rate per unit time) which must be greater than 0. 5.5.2.0.4 Shapes The distribution can take on unimodal shapes with varying amounts of right skew (from none, to an exponential shape). 5.5.2.0.5 PDF or PMF The Poisson PMF is: \\[P(X=k \\vert \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}\\] 5.5.2.0.6 Examples The Poisson distribution might be used to model any response variable that is comprised of counts, for example, the number of birds sighted in a bird survey, or the number of people admitted to an emergency room each hour. 5.5.3 Negative Binomial There are two versions or ‚Äútypes‚Äù of this distribution, cleverly known as NB1 (type 1) and NB2 (type 2). NB1 has ‚Äúconstant overdispersion‚Äù ‚Äì the variance of the distribution is greater than the mean according to a constant ratio. NB2 has ‚Äúvariable overdispersion‚Äù ‚Äì the variance is a quadratic function of the mean. The NB2 is the one that corresponds directly to conceptualization in terms of binomial trials (with the PMF giving the probability of observing \\(y\\) failures before the \\(r\\)th success). Hardin and Hilbe 2007 describe the negative binomial this way: ‚ÄúInstead of counts entering uniformly, we see counts entering with a specific gamma-distributed shape.‚Äù 5.5.3.0.1 Type Discrete 5.5.3.0.2 Support The support is 0 and positive integers (i.e., this distribution works well for count data). It also has a derivation in terms of binomial trials, but in our regression models, we will only use it with count data. 5.5.3.0.3 Parameters A common parameterization of the negative binomial (online and in actuarial science) has parameters \\(p\\), the probability of success on each binomial trial, and \\(r\\), the number of failures observed. The PMF then gives the probability of observing \\(k\\) failures before the \\(r\\)th success in a series of Bernoulli trials. Here, we will use an alternate parameterization. The other common way to parameterize and derive the NB is as a Poisson-gamma mixture ‚Äì a modified version of a Poisson distribution. In this scheme, the parameters of the distribution are \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\alpha\\). 5.5.3.0.4 Shapes These distributions can take on unimodal shapes with varying amounts of right skew. In NB2 (type 2) distributions the variance (spread) is larger relative to the mean. NB1: NB2: 5.5.3.0.5 PDF or PMF Details of the parameterizations and likelihood and fitting of NB1 and NB2 distributions can be found in Hardin and Hilbe 2007, if you are interested. The PMF for the NB1, where the variance is a constant multiple of the mean, is: \\[ f(x \\vert \\mu, \\alpha) = \\frac{\\Gamma(x + \\mu)}{\\Gamma(\\mu)\\Gamma(x+1)}(\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha})^\\mu(\\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\alpha})^x \\] Where \\(\\Gamma\\) is a Gamma function. Note that if \\(\\alpha\\) = 0 this becomes a Poisson distribution, so the Poisson is a special case of the NB1. The PMF for the NB2, where the variance is a quadratic function of the mean, is: \\[ f(x \\vert \\mu, \\alpha) = \\frac{\\Gamma(x + \\frac{1}{\\alpha})}{\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{\\alpha})\\Gamma(x+1)}(\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha \\mu})^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}(1 - \\frac{1}{1+\\alpha \\mu})^x \\] 5.5.3.0.6 Examples NB distributions are good models for overdispersed count data, where (in the regression context) the residual variance is not equal to the expected (predicted) value. (Note that if you are reading this before learning about regression models for count data, you may not understand this sentence yet‚Ä¶don‚Äôt worry, it will make sense when you return later!) Some examples might include sightings data on numbers of animals seen on wildlife surveys, or the number of items bought per order at an online retailer. 5.5.4 A Mixture Distribution: Tweedie The Tweedie family of distributions is a very large one - depending on the values of the different parameters, the PMF/PDF can be written in many different ways, and it can take on many different shapes. The description below is a simplified one, geared toward the types of Tweedie distributions we are likely to try to use in regression models in this course ‚Äì mainly the ‚Äúcompound Poisson-gamma‚Äù type. Some extra resources for which you will not be held responsible in this course: You can find an accessible description and example of this kind of distribution at: http://www.notenoughthoughts.net/posts/modeling-activity.html. The following site may also be useful in regard to using the Tweedie in regression models: http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/68162/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_genmod_details28.htm 5.5.4.0.1 Type These distributions are both continuous and discrete - a kind of mix of a Poisson distribution and gamma distribution(s). 5.5.4.0.2 Support The support is non-negative real numbers (greater than or equal to 0). 5.5.4.0.3 Parameters (Note: there are multiple different ways to parameterize these distributions.) We will use: \\(p\\), the index or power parameter, which can be 0 (resulting in a normal distribution), 1 (resulting in a Poisson distribution), \\(1 &lt; p &lt; 2\\) (a compound Poisson-gamma distribution ‚Äì what we will mainly use), 2 (a gamma distribution), 3 (an inverse Gaussian distribution), \\(&lt;3\\) (a positive stable distribution), or \\(\\infty\\) (an extreme positive stable distribuiton). For the case where \\(1 &lt; p &lt; 2\\), and the distribution is a compound of a Poisson and a gamma, then \\(p = \\frac{k+2}{k+1}\\) where \\(k\\) is the parameter of the gamma distribution. When \\(1&lt;p&lt;2\\), \\(p\\) closer to 1 means thant the Poisson distribution (the mass at 0) gets more ‚Äúweight‚Äù in the compound distribution, and values of \\(p\\) closer to 2 mean that the gamma distribution gets more ‚Äúweight.‚Äù \\(\\mu\\). For the case where \\(1 &lt; p &lt; 2\\), and the distribution is a compound of a Poisson and a gamma, then \\(\\mu = \\lambda k \\theta\\) where \\(\\lambda\\) is the parameter of the Poisson distribution and \\(k\\) and \\(\\theta\\) are the parameters of the gamma. \\(\\phi\\) For the case where \\(1 &lt; p &lt; 2\\), and the distribution is a compound of a Poisson and a gamma, then \\(\\phi = \\frac{\\lambda^{(1-p)} (k \\theta) ^{(2-p)}}{2-p}\\) where \\(\\lambda\\) is the parameter of the Poisson distribution and \\(k\\) and \\(\\theta\\) are the parameters of the gamma. 5.5.4.0.4 Shapes A compound Poisson-gamma Tweedie distribution can take on varying shapes; the main characteristic of interest for us is that it can have a mass at 0, then a unimodal or multimodal distribution with a long right tail (lots of right skew). 5.5.4.0.5 PDF or PMF A Tweedie distribution with \\(p&gt;1\\) has the form: \\[ f(X \\vert \\mu, \\phi, p) = a(x, \\phi)e^{\\frac{1}{\\phi}(\\frac{x\\mu^{(1-p)}}{(1-p)} - \\kappa(\\mu,p))}\\] where \\(\\kappa(\\mu,p) = \\frac{\\mu^{(2-p)}}{(2-p)}\\) if \\(p\\neq2\\), and if \\(p=2\\), \\(\\kappa(\\mu,p) = log(\\mu)\\); but \\(a(x,\\phi)\\) is a function that does not have an analytical expression. This expression is from SAS documentation at https://support.sas.com/rnd/app/stat/examples/tweedie/tweedie.pdf. Alternately (and more simply(?)), a Tweedie distribution with \\(1 &lt; p &lt; 2\\) is a compound of a Poisson distribution with parameter \\(\\lambda\\) and a gamma distribution with parameters \\(k\\) and \\(\\theta\\). For example: ‚ÄúSuppose that airplanes arrive at an airport following a Poisson process, and the number of passengers in each airplane follows a certain gamma distribution. Then, the number of passengers arriving at the airport follows a compound Poisson gamma process \\[ Y = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} D_i\\] where \\(N\\) is the Poisson process that the airplanes follow, and \\(D_i\\) is the gamma distribution that the passengers follow.‚Äù (Thanks to D. Mao, http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2013/REUPapers/Mao.pdf for this example.) 5.5.4.0.6 Examples The Tweedie distributions may be useful for ‚Äúzero-inflated‚Äù data, where there is a class of observations for which the observed value of the variable is always zero, and another class for which the variable takes on positive continuous values. For example, this might model the number of birds present per unit area (when the study area includes places of unsuitable habitat where none are ever found), or perhaps the quantity of alcohol consumed per week by different people (some of whom may drink varying amounts, and others of whom may never drink at all).

Response variable (y) contains count data Linearity: \\(log(\\lambda_{i})\\) is a linear function of the covariates \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), ‚Ä¶ \\(x_n\\). (Later we will consider how to check this when some covariates are quantitative‚Ä¶in brief: plot log(rate) as a function of each covariate and look for (no non-)linear trend.) Mean = Variance Independence (of residuals) There is not a condition specifying a PDF that the residuals should follow. 6.4.3 Model Assessment Which conditions can we check already? acf(resid(prm, type=&#39;response&#39;), main=&#39;bee.lm Residuals&#39;) What does type='response' mean? This means that the residuals are reported on the same scale as the response variable (that is, in units of counts, rather than log(counts)). This trumpet pattern is what we expect! Why? If the variance equals the mean, then as the mean (fitted value) goes up, then the variance (spread of residuals) will also be larger. But how can we decide if it‚Äôs the right amount of increase in variance with increase in fitted value? We can compute Pearson residuals, which are scaled by the expected variance. The Pearson residuals should have approximately constant variance as a function of fitted values, and a standard deviation of about 1. A more complex solution: we could divide the fitted values into bins (choice of bin size is somewhat arbitrary; generally, you want them as small as possible, but still containing enough observations per bin to get good mean and variance estimates). In each bin, compute the mean and the variance of the residuals. Plot these means vs these variances and see if the slope is 1 (and intercept 0). First, split the fitted values into 5 bins: ## colony beename treatment target.colour novisits flower ## 1 Y giantbeeYsucroseyellow Sucrose yellow 12 target ## 2 W o51Wsucroseblue Sucrose blue 8 target ## 3 W o54Wquinineblue Quinine blue 13 target ## 4 W o58Wcelluloseyellow Cellulose yellow 9 target ## 5 W o60Wcelluloseblue Cellulose blue 11 target ## 6 W o63Wquinineblue Quinine blue 5 target ## lm.resids lm.fitted pm.resids pm.fitted pm.pearson.resids fitted.bins ## 1 3.5585187 8.441481 4.1360526 7.863947 1.4749108 (7.57,9.88] ## 2 -2.2907806 10.290781 -4.1767222 12.176722 -1.1969345 (9.88,12.2] ## 3 5.4331935 7.566806 7.0105824 5.989418 2.8645856 (5.27,7.57] ## 4 -1.2551114 10.255111 -3.0392024 12.039202 -0.8759126 (9.88,12.2] ## 5 0.7448886 10.255111 -1.0392024 12.039202 -0.2995031 (9.88,12.2] ## 6 -2.5668065 7.566806 -0.9894176 5.989418 -0.4042847 (5.27,7.57] Next, compute the means and variances in each bin, view the result, and plot: ## # A tibble: 5 x 3 ## fitted.bins mean var ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (0.661,2.97] 1.77 3.34 ## 2 (2.97,5.27] 4.28 10.6 ## 3 (5.27,7.57] 5.99 21.3 ## 4 (7.57,9.88] 7.83 12.8 ## 5 (9.88,12.2] 11.5 13.5 That‚Äôs a bit of a pain, and still a judgment call at the end. How else can we check the Mean = Variance condition? 6.4.4 Checking for overdispersion using overdispersion factor We can estimate the overdispersion factor. This satisfies \\[ \\text{residual variance} = \\text{overdispersion factor} * \\text{mean}\\] So if it‚Äôs a lot larger than 1, we have a problem. The function overdisp_fun() in package s245 computes an estimate: ## chisq ratio rdf p ## 5.383705e+02 2.047036e+00 2.630000e+02 4.288147e-21 Here, it‚Äôs about 2: not too terrible, but still, residual variance is double what it should be according to our model. (Usually if the overdispersion is larger than 2 we will prefer a different model that better accounts for the fact that \\(\\text{mean} \\neq \\text{variance}\\).) 6.5 Accounting for overdispersion: Negative Binomial Models Finally, we could simply fit a model that allows for a more permissive mean-variance relationship (where the variance can be larger or smaller than the mean, by different amounts), and see if it is a better fit to the data according it our IC.

How can we use model selection criteria in a case where the likelihood can‚Äôt be computed exactly? The quasi (log) likelihood is an approximation to the likelihood. It has some properties in common with a (log) likelihood, but is not a likelihood; we resort to using it in cases where the (log) likelihood can not even be evaluated. With some code/mathematical gymnastics, we can use principles of quasi-likelihood to estimate QAIC (quasi-AIC, or AIC based on quasi-likelihood) in R for model selection. 6.7.1 Review: all subsets selection with dredge() What if, instead of comparing two (or a few) specific models, we want to compare all possible models that contain some combination of a set of candidate covariates? The package MuMIn contains a function, dredge(), that takes as input a ‚Äúfull‚Äù model (one containing all the candidate covariates). It then computes AIC (or other model selection criteria) for all possible models containing subsets of the covariate and reports the results in a ranked table. For example, for our Poisson regression model, we could do: require(MuMIn) #have to make sure na.action is &#39;na.fail&#39; for input model prm &lt;- update(prm, na.action=&#39;na.fail&#39;) dredge(prm, rank=&#39;AIC&#39;) ## Global model call: glm(formula = novisits ~ flower + treatment + colony, family = poisson(link = &quot;log&quot;), ## data = beevisits, na.action = &quot;na.fail&quot;) ## --- ## Model selection table ## (Intrc) colny flowr trtmn df logLik AIC delta weight ## 8 0.7905 + + + 7 -623.310 1260.6 0.00 1 ## 7 0.6428 + + 5 -642.317 1294.6 34.01 0 ## 4 1.3100 + + 5 -677.205 1364.4 103.79 0 ## 3 1.1560 + 3 -695.120 1396.2 135.62 0 ## 6 1.1240 + + 5 -898.637 1807.3 546.65 0 ## 5 0.9767 + 3 -917.644 1841.3 580.67 0 ## 2 1.6440 + 3 -952.532 1911.1 650.44 0 ## 1 1.4900 1 -970.446 1942.9 682.27 0 ## Models ranked by AIC(x) dredge(prm, rank=&#39;BIC&#39;) ## Global model call: glm(formula = novisits ~ flower + treatment + colony, family = poisson(link = &quot;log&quot;), ## data = beevisits, na.action = &quot;na.fail&quot;) ## --- ## Model selection table ## (Intrc) colny flowr trtmn df logLik BIC delta weight ## 8 0.7905 + + + 7 -623.310 1285.8 0.00 1 ## 7 0.6428 + + 5 -642.317 1312.6 26.82 0 ## 4 1.3100 + + 5 -677.205 1382.4 96.59 0 ## 3 1.1560 + 3 -695.120 1407.0 121.23 0 ## 6 1.1240 + + 5 -898.637 1825.3 539.46 0 ## 5 0.9767 + 3 -917.644 1852.1 566.27 0 ## 2 1.6440 + 3 -952.532 1921.9 636.05 0 ## 1 1.4900 1 -970.446 1946.5 660.68 0 ## Models ranked by BIC(x) 6.7.2 Review: IC ‚Äúweights‚Äù Note the last two columns of the dredge output: the ‚Äúdelta‚Äù (or \\(\\delta\\)) AIC or BIC values and the ‚Äúweights‚Äù. The \\(\\delta\\)s are obtained by simply subtracting the best model‚Äôs IC value from that of each other model. We already mentioned a rule of thumb: that the \\(\\delta IC\\) should be at least 3 or to provide reasonable evidence that one model is really better than the other. Another way of measuring the differences between models is to use model weights. Theoretically, these measure the relative likelihoods of different models; you can think of them as giving the probability that a given model is the best-fitting one in the set of models examined, according to the IC being used. Model weights are computed simply according to: \\[ e^\\frac{-\\delta IC}{2}\\] And they sum to one for all models in a dredge(). 6.7.3 Extending dredge() to quasi-Likelihood With (rather a lot of) effort to define some custom functions, we can do the same thing for a quasi-Poisson model using quasi-AIC. Note: This idea is based on notes by Ben Bolker provided with the R package bbmle. ## Global model call: glm(formula = novisits ~ flower + treatment + colony, family = family, ## data = beevisits, na.action = na.action) ## --- ## Model selection table ## (Intrc) colny flowr trtmn df logLik rank delta weight ## 8 0.7905 + + + 7 -623.310 625.0 0.00 0.999 ## 7 0.6428 + + 5 -642.317 639.5 14.57 0.001 ## 4 1.3100 + + 5 -677.205 673.6 48.66 0.000 ## 3 1.1560 + 3 -695.120 687.1 62.16 0.000 ## 6 1.1240 + + 5 -898.637 890.0 265.00 0.000 ## 5 0.9767 + 3 -917.644 904.5 279.57 0.000 ## 2 1.6440 + 3 -952.532 938.6 313.65 0.000 ## 1 1.4900 1 -970.446 952.1 327.15 0.000 ## Models ranked by rank(x, chat = 2.04707063774377) Note: the qdredge() function is also provided for you in the package s245. So if you do want to use this, all you need to do is use s245::qdredge() instead of dredge(). 6.8 Offsets In our model, the response variable was the number of flowers visited by a bee, and each bee was in the same experimental setting for the same amount of time, so there was no need to account for effort or time spent in each case. This is not always true: consider, for example: Dolphin surveys Bird counts Consider the schools and crime example from homework as well In this case, it would be natural to adjust for effort. The intuitive way to do it would be to use counts per unit effort as the response variable: \\[ log(\\frac{\\lambda_i}{effort}) = \\beta_0 + \\dots \\] But notice that this is equivalent to including \\(log(effort)\\) as an ``offset\" on the right hand side of the regression equation: \\[ log(\\lambda_i) = \\beta_0 + \\dots + log(effort)\\] This is how we specify models with offsets in R: offset.mod &lt;- glm(counts ~ predictor1 + predictor2 + offset(log(effort)), family=poisson) Note: if you use dredge() with a model with an offset, be sure to specify the offset as a ‚Äúfixed‚Äù term, i.e. a term that must be included in all models: dredge(offset.mod, fixed = &#39;offset(log(effort))&#39;) 6.9 Prediction Plots Once you have a ‚Äúbest‚Äù model, how do you interpret it? When we went to great lengths to make prediction plots for a linear regression model so we could ‚Äúsee‚Äù the slope of the predicted relationship, you may have wondered: why bother? I can just look at the slope estimate and get the same insight! Now, with a more complicated model equation with a link function, it‚Äôs not so easy. Now, we will really appreciate those prediction plots! With the link function and the Poisson distribution, it is more challenging to interpret the coefficients of the model directly. The easiest way to understand the effects of different predictors is to look at plots of model predictions. However, as always we don‚Äôt want to plot fitted(model) as a function of each predictor in a model with more than one predictor; predictors other than the one we are interested in will influence the predictions, introducing extra variation. Instead, we will construct a new (fake) dataset to make predictions for, in which all predictors but the one we are interested in are held constant. For example, using our quasi-Poisson model and looking at the effect of colony (predicted values with 95% CIs): If we had a quantitative predictor instead, the process would be similar, except when we define newdata, we would have to choose a range and granularity for which to make predictions. For example, imagine if bee length in mm was one of our predictors, and we wanted predictions for lengths between 0.5 and 3 mm (with a value every 0.05mm). We might begin: ## bee.length colony flower target.colour treatment ## 1 0.05 W familiar blue Cellulose ## 2 0.10 W familiar blue Cellulose ## 3 0.15 W familiar blue Cellulose ## 4 0.20 W familiar blue Cellulose ## 5 0.25 W familiar blue Cellulose ## 6 0.30 W familiar blue Cellulose Then, when we make the plot, we would need to use gf\\_ribbon() instead of gf\\_errorbar() to show the CI. We can also use pred_plot(fitted_model, 'variable_name') to make these plots with a lot less code (and if you need to know the values at which other predictors are fixed, use get_fixed(dataset)). "],
